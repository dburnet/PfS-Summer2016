# Demonstrations from Class

Topically organized Demonstrations and Examples from class. These are usually the stuff I show you while doing demonstrations. All Jupyter worksheets tested against Anaconda (recent version April-May 2016) on OSX **or** Anaconda on Windows 7/10. Usually not tested on both.
