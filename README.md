# Programming for Scientists (PfS/P4S)
## Summer2016 - Georgia State University

This repository contains _mostly_ original materials (in **Python**, **R**, and **bash** primarily) used in the 2016 version of the Programming for Scientists (P4S) class at Georgia State University (GSU). The course is (was?) taught by [Matthew Turner](https://github.com/mdtdev) for the Psychology department.

All original materials are released under the [MIT license](http://mit-license.org/). If this course is adapted for use elsewhere, please cite this repository and/or the author. (It helps justify the continuing development of the materials.) :smile:

If you find bugs or other problems (or improvements!) please do open an issue!

Cheers!
